Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning

🔹 Overview

This project is a Machine Learning-based Disease Prediction System that predicts the likelihood of Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson’s Disease based on user inputs. It uses Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression models and is deployed using Streamlit.

🔹 Features

✅ Predicts Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson’s Disease✅ Uses Random Forest as the final model for best accuracy✅ Streamlit-based UI for easy interaction✅ Balanced dataset using SMOTE for better performance✅ Deployed for real-time predictions

🔹 Datasets Used

Diabetes Dataset: Contains medical attributes like glucose, BMI, and age.

Heart Disease Dataset: Includes features like blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart rate.

Parkinson’s Dataset: Uses voice-related metrics for detection.

🔹 Technologies Used

Python 3.x

Machine Learning Models: Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression

Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Imbalanced-learn, Streamlit

Deployment: Streamlit Web App
